This is a partner project from about a year ago.

This project is a web application that requires a login before allowing the user to view a calendar and add tasks to their schedule each day. Users can view and edit tasks in their
daily schedule.
Requires multiple Google Chrome plugins to run the project. The javascript code is mostly a mess due to inexperience with javascript and strange json behavior that caused
us to completely redesign most of our frontend scripts in the last minute to meet our deliverables.
