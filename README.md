This is a partner project from about a year ago.

This project is a web application that requires a login before allowing the user to view a calendar and add tasks to their schedule each day. Users can view and edit tasks in theirdaily schedule.

Requires multiple Google Chrome plugins to run the project, most of which I cannot remember due to uninstalling them as they were slowing down my browser. The javascript code is mostly a mess due to inexperience with javascript and strange json behavior that causedus to completely redesign most of our frontend scripts in the last minute to meet our deliverables.
